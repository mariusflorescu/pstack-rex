# Swarm

A skill named in bold or in backticks, or run as `/<name>`, is the file `../<name>/SKILL.md` beside this skill's directory, and a principle named without its prefix is `../principle-<name>/SKILL.md`. Read the file and follow it. Most pstack skills are user-only, so your skill tool cannot load them. Every subagent is a Rex worker pane: spawn, wait and close it per `../rex-subagents/SKILL.md`, with the defaults in the Subagents section of `../poteto-mode/SKILL.md`.

## Start

Open a task list (your harness's task tool, or a checklist file at `~/.local/state/pstack/checklists/<repo>-<branch>.md` when it has none) with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in `~/.config/pstack/pstack-models.md`, and pass the entry to `subagent spawn --entry` as written. For `auto` or `inherit-parent`, or when the file or that line is missing, run the workers on your own harness and its default model. With no file, say so and suggest `/setup-pstack`. If a worker's model is rejected, run that worker on its harness's default model and say so. For a model race, name each arm's model up front. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.
4. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one turn, one `subagent spawn` each, named for the slice or race arm, with the step 3 entry. Workers share your checkout, so parallel writers there own disjoint files and run no git commands. A worker that writes, or must start from another commit or branch, gets its own `--worktree <branch> --base <commit or branch>`. Commit first, because uncommitted edits do not reach a new worktree. One writer per worktree or branch.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

End the turn after spawning. Each worker's wake-up line starts your next turn. If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with a result table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
